# Pathfinder algorithm

Simple CLI pathfinder algorithm, written in GO

## Goal

Make a pathfinder algorithm capable of finding the shortest path between two points using a 2D array as a map.

It must :

- Travel **only up/down** and **left/right**, _no diagonals allowed_
- Travel through 1s and avoid 0s
- Return the distance of the shortest path
- Return the map with the path displayed
- Return an error message if there are no paths, invalid data is provided, etc...
